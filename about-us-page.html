            <h3>What Was Used To Make This Website</h3>
            <p>This website was mainly created through using Php and MySQL. The Php code
                allowed for the implementation of MySQL code as well as a couple other
                features to run through a given database. We would be given the data from
                a database and would iterate through all of the entries listed in the database
                until we have found the corresponding song based on what the user has inputed. 
            </p>
